**JieLi Technology - Chips Delight the World.**

## Who is the JieLi?

JieLi (杰理) "JL"/"Jerry" was based in 2010 in the ZhuHai city of Guangdong, China.

Their chips can be found in various cheap MP3 players, Bluetooth speakers, Bluetooth/MP3 modules,
dash cams, etc.

If not them, then maybe from some other companies like Buildwin/Appotech, Actions Semi, Bluetrum, RDA, Beken...

The chips can be identified by them having an slanted "JL"/"π" logo,
and the "nonsense" markings like "AB1526CG3X1F.1-82E", "AC1631097294-04A", etc.
