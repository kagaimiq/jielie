#### For AC309N

- [go2net/kt-rec-pro]
- [go2net/my-com-rec]

#### For AC690N

- [USMI-Tech/AC690X-SDK]
- [christian-kramer/JieLi-AC690X-Familiarization] has an AC690N SDK

#### For AC692N

- [USMI-Tech/AC692X-SDK]
- [qqq5127/AC6901_clock] - That seems to be a AC692N SDK rather than a AC690N one

#### For AC695N

- [qqq5127/AC6951] - Incomplete SDK, but it has a Linux version of `isd_download`!!
- *[USMI-Tech/AC695X-SDK]* - that's a stub

#### For AC696N

- [qqq5127/AC6966B] - Same thing as with the "AC6951" SDK above (linux tools & a bit incomplete).
- [jiang20082233/AC6966B-JBD] - Complete SDK
- *[USMI-Tech/AC696X-SDK]* - that's a stub

## Some forum thread series

A forum thread series I've been following for the whole time.
The list is in descending order of creation.

- [USMI forum](https://usmi.mybb.ru/viewtopic.php?id=4) *(current active thread)*
- [Tehnodium](http://web.archive.org/web/20220517054814/https://tehnodium.ru/thread-5.html) *(inactive)*
  * Has been removed few months after a controversy..
  * The archived link above seems to be complete.
- [ESP8266 forum](https://esp8266.ru/forum/threads/jl-soc.5500) *(still around)*
  * Still around but that's not really a preferred option, better follow the USMI forum thread above... But if you want, you do you.
  * Was started around the shemaforum thread lifetime, then after being locked out off tehnodium the "conversation" (more like debates on whether JieLi is a thing worth putting effort into) was going on for a while since, until the USMI forum was started in dec. 2022.
- [Shemaforum](https://web.archive.org/web/20210511195409/https://shemaforum.ru/topic/jl-soc-ac109n-ac209n-ac309n-ac410n-ac460n-ac690n/) *(inactive)*
  * Has been closing due to moving to tehnodium
  * The archived link above is unfortunately incomplete - the website itself has gone now.
- [Radioskot](http://web.archive.org/web/20190401022412/https://radioskot.ru/forum/11-14227-1) *(inactive)*
  * Has been closed due to moving to shemaforum
  * A working read-only mirror is available on [cxemi.ru](https://cxemi.ru/forum/11-14227-1)

## Something else

Things I thought worth mentioning

### bigclive buddha machine thing

That thing uses an SH50 (AD100 series) chip under a blob..

- [The video itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNpbvyLIvN0)
- [Reddit thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/BigCliveDotCom/comments/pmt390/buddha_machine_teardown_with_flash_dump/?sort=new) - just straight off copied the link from the cactus page from leo.leung.xyz
- [unbuddha](https://github.com/Spritetm/unbuddha) - a firmware parser & maker for that thing
- [vimutti](https://github.com/davidgiven/vimutti) - another firmware parser
- [buddha machine firmware tool](https://github.com/uzlonewolf/BuddhaMachineFirmwareTool) - yet another one

### dancing cactus thing

This thing uses an AD142A (SH54 family) chip.

- [leo.leung.xyz](https://leo.leung.xyz/wiki/Dancing_Cactus) page - where I get to know about the buddha thing above, too. There are some snippets out of the flash dump, but not the full dump.
- [remont aud firmware dump page](https://remont-aud.net/dump/prochie/detskie_ehlektronnye_igrushki/tancujushhij_kaktus_ab22bp00513_42a0_shassi_main_board_zy_f4556/479-1-0-121819) - well it's of no use for all of us.
- [an issue from unbuddha repo](https://github.com/Spritetm/unbuddha/issues/1) - once again, flash dump has NOT been provided.

## don't ask why

- [what.. (Java class com.jieli.xxx)](http://jieli.com/) ~ in 2020 there was some ghibli stuff then some more then only cnphotos is there, whattt
